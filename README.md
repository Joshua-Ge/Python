# 🐍 Python Projects by Joshua-Ge

Welcome to my Python projects repository! This is a collection of exercises, tools, games, and learning experiments designed to explore various aspects of Python programming.

## 📁 Project Directories

- [🎮 Games](./Games) — Interactive games like `cookingGame.py` and others.
- [📄 PDF Tools](./PDF) — Scripts for manipulating or generating PDFs.
- [🏛️ Python Classes](./PythonClasses) — Object-oriented programming examples.
- [🛠️ Random Tools](./RandomTools) — Miscellaneous useful scripts.
- [📚 Dictionaries](./dictionaries) — Practice exercises using Python dictionaries.
- [🔁 Loops](./loops) — Examples and exercises using loops.

## 🧮 Standalone Scripts

- [🧮 calc.py](./calc.py) — Basic calculator.
- [➗ quadraticCalc.py](./quadraticCalc.py) — Quadratic equation solver.
- [🌱 SmallGarden.py](./SmallGarden.py) — Garden simulation or related project.
- [A*](./Astar.py) - This is a self developed A* algorith which uses no libaries
- [Another A*](./Astar_reimplication.py) - This is another A* algorithm but instead of navigating a maze it navigates
- [Breadth First Search](./BFS.py) - This is a self implementation of BFS
- [Depth First Search](./DFS.py) - This is a self implementation of DFS
- [3rd Ai model](https://github.com/Joshua-Ge/Python/tree/main/Python%20square%20roots) - This AI model predicts the square root of any number with an accuracy of 99.99%
